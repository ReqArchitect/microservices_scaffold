# Enhanced Microservices Architecture

This directory contains enhanced components to strengthen the Flask microservices architecture. The following improvements have been implemented:

## 1. Service Mesh with Envoy

A lightweight service mesh implementation using Envoy proxy has been added to provide:

- Request routing and load balancing
- Health checking
- Circuit breaking
- Metrics collection
- Retries and timeouts

**Key files:**
- `service_mesh/envoy.yaml` - Envoy proxy configuration
- `docker-compose-enhanced.yml` - Integration with other services

## 2. Service Registry and Discovery

A service registry using Consul allows dynamic discovery of services:

- Automatic service registration
- Health checks
- DNS-based service discovery
- Configuration store

**Key files:**
- `common_utils/service_registry.py` - Registry client for Flask apps
- `service_registry/docker-compose.yml` - Consul container configuration
- `service_registry/requirements.txt` - Required dependencies

## 3. Distributed Tracing and Monitoring

End-to-end request tracing allows debugging and performance monitoring:

- Jaeger tracing integration
- Request ID propagation
- Visualizing request paths across services
- Identifying bottlenecks

**Key files:**
- `common_utils/tracing.py` - OpenTelemetry integration for Flask
- `monitoring/jaeger/docker-compose.yml` - Jaeger container setup
- `monitoring/requirements.txt` - Tracing dependencies

## 4. Data Consistency Patterns (Outbox Pattern)

Ensuring data consistency across microservices with the Outbox pattern:

- Transactional message publishing
- At-least-once delivery guarantee
- Idempotent processing
- Automatic event creation from model changes

**Key files:**
- `common_utils/outbox.py` - Outbox pattern implementation

## 5. API Versioning Strategy

Clear API versioning allowing services to evolve independently:

- URL-based versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
- Explicit version headers
- Backward compatibility support
- Latest version discovery

**Key files:**
- `common_utils/versioning.py` - API versioning utilities for Flask

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes)

Kubernetes manifests for deploying the services in a scalable way:

- Deployments with auto-scaling
- Service discovery
- Config maps and secrets
- Persistent volumes for databases
- Health probes and resource limits

**Key files:**
- `k8s/common-infrastructure.yaml` - Core infrastructure services
- `k8s/strategy-service.yaml` - Example service deployment

## Getting Started

### Running with Enhanced Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-enhanced.yml up
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Apply infrastructure components
kubectl apply -f k8s/common-infrastructure.yaml

# Deploy individual services
kubectl apply -f k8s/strategy-service.yaml
```

### Accessing Services

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:10000
- **Consul UI**: http://localhost:8500
- **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686

## Additional Notes

1. For production use, replace the hardcoded secrets with a proper secrets management solution.
2. Scale individual services based on their specific requirements.
3. Add monitoring alerts for key metrics.
4. Implement proper backup strategies for persistent volumes.
5. Consider adding a proper CI/CD pipeline for deployments.
