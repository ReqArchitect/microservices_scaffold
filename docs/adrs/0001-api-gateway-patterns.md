# ADR 0001: API Gateway Patterns

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The ReqArchitect microservices architecture requires standardized API management, including rate limiting, circuit breaking, and request validation. We need to ensure consistent handling of cross-cutting concerns across all services.

## Decision
We will implement the following patterns in the API Gateway:
1. Rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
2. Circuit breaking with three states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN)
3. Request validation using OpenAPI specifications
4. Service discovery via Consul integration
5. Standardized response schemas
6. Caching strategy with Redis

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved resilience and stability
- Consistent API behavior across services
- Better resource utilization through rate limiting
- Simplified service-to-service communication

### Negative
- Additional latency through gateway
- Increased complexity in deployment
- Need for careful configuration management

## Implementation Notes
- Rate limits will be configurable per tenant and endpoint
- Circuit breaker thresholds will be service-specific
- Cache TTL will be configurable per endpoint
- All APIs will be documented using OpenAPI 3.0
